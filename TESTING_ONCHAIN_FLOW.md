- ‚úÖ Event Logs: Should show `PolicyCreated` event with:
  - `policyId`: Your policy ID number
  - `holder`: Your address
  - `coverageAmount`: Amount you insured
  - `premium`: Premium paid

**Take Note:**

- Copy the **Policy ID** from the event logs
- You'll need this for submitting claims

---

## Test Flow 2: View Your Active Policies

### A. Navigate to Claims Center

1. Go to `/claims` or click "Claims Center"
2. Wait for policies to load (you'll see "Loading..." indicator)

### B. Verify Your Policy Appears

You should see your purchased policy displayed as a card:

4. Call `getPolicy` function with your Policy ID
5. **Compare:**
   - holder ‚Üí Should match your address
   - coverageAmount ‚Üí Should match UI
   - premium ‚Üí Should match UI
   - startTime ‚Üí Should match start date
   - endTime ‚Üí Should match end date
   - active ‚Üí Should be `true`

‚úÖ **If everything matches, your UI is reading real on-chain data!**

**You should see:**

1. ‚è≥ "Submitting claim..." with tx link
2. ‚úÖ "Claim submitted successfully!" when confirmed

**Click transaction link to HashScan:**

```
https://hashscan.io/testnet/tx/0x[claim-tx-hash]
```

**Verify on HashScan:**

### B. Verify Prices are Live

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Look for requests to `/api/prices?symbols=ETH,BTC,HBAR`
4. Check the response - prices should have:
   - `price`: Current price
   - `change24h`: 24-hour change percentage
   - `lastUpdate`: Recent timestamp
   - `confidence`: Confidence interval

### C. Compare with Pyth Network

1. Visit Pyth Price Feeds: https://pyth.network/price-feeds
2. Find ETH/USD or BTC/USD
3. Compare prices - they should match (within confidence interval)

‚úÖ **If prices update every 30 seconds and match Pyth, you're using live oracle data!**

---

## Test Flow 5: Cross-Chain Coverage (CCIP)

### A. Navigate to Cross-Chain Page

1. Go to `/crosschain`
2. You should see the Cross-Chain Coverage interface

### B. Select Destination Chain

1. Choose a destination chain (e.g., Ethereum Sepolia)
2. Select asset to cover
3. Enter coverage amount
4. Set duration

### C. Estimate CCIP Fee

- UI should show estimated CCIP bridge fee
- This is calculated based on:
  - Destination chain
  - Message size
  - Gas costs

### D. Send Cross-Chain Message

1. Click **"Purchase Cross-Chain Coverage"**
2. Approve transaction with CCIP fee included
3. Transaction will:
   - Lock funds on source chain
   - Send CCIP message to destination
   - Create coverage on destination chain

### E. Track Cross-Chain Message

**On HashScan:**

1. View your transaction
2. Look for `CrossChainCoverageSent` event
3. Copy the `messageId`
4. Use CCIP Explorer to track: https://ccip.chain.link/

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Insufficient Balance" Error

**Solution:**

- Get more test HBAR from faucet
- Try smaller coverage amount

### Issue: Transaction Fails

**Solution:**

1. Check gas settings in wallet
2. Ensure you have enough HBAR
3. Verify contract addresses are correct
4. Check Hedera testnet status: https://status.hedera.com/

### Issue: No Policies Show Up

**Solution:**

1. Wait 10-15 seconds after purchase
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify wallet is connected to correct network

### Issue: Transaction Link Doesn't Work

**Solution:**

1. Make sure transaction is confirmed
2. Copy tx hash manually and search on HashScan
3. Check you're on testnet HashScan, not mainnet

### Issue: Prices Not Updating

**Solution:**

1. Check network connection
2. Open DevTools and look for API errors
3. Pyth Hermes API might be rate-limiting - wait a minute
4. Fallback prices will be used if Pyth is unavailable

---

## Advanced Testing

### Test Pool Balance

1. Check initial pool balance on contract
2. Purchase multiple policies
3. Verify pool balance increases by premium amounts
4. Submit and approve claim
5. Verify pool balance decreases by claim amount

### Test Policy Expiration

1. Create policy with very short duration (7 days)
2. Wait for policy to expire
3. Try submitting claim after expiration
4. Should fail with "Policy Expired" or "Inactive" error

### Test Risk Scoring

1. Purchase coverage with different assets (ETH vs BTC vs HBAR)
2. Note different premium rates
3. Try different durations
4. Longer duration = higher premium
5. Riskier asset (HBAR) = higher premium

### Test Event Filtering

1. Create multiple policies from different accounts
2. Each user should only see their own policies
3. Event filtering by `holder` address

---

## Debugging Tools

### Browser DevTools

```javascript
// Open Console (F12) and run:

// Check contract addresses
console.log("InsurancePool:", "0xA7c59f010700930003b33aB25a7a0679C860f29c");

// Check network
console.log("Network:", window.ethereum.networkVersion);

// Check connected account
window.ethereum
  .request({ method: "eth_accounts" })
  .then((accounts) => console.log("Connected:", accounts[0]));
```

### HashScan API

```bash
# Get contract transactions
curl "https://testnet.hashscan.io/api/v1/contracts/0xA7c59f010700930003b33aB25a7a0679C860f29c/results"

# Get specific transaction
curl "https://testnet.hashscan.io/api/v1/transactions/[tx-hash]"
```

### Hardhat Console (Backend)

```bash
# Connect to contract
npx hardhat console --network hedera-testnet

# In console:
const InsurancePool = await ethers.getContractAt("InsurancePool", "0xA7c59f010700930003b33aB25a7a0679C860f29c");

# Check pool balance
const balance = await InsurancePool.totalPoolBalance();
console.log("Pool Balance:", ethers.formatEther(balance), "HBAR");

# Get policy
const policy = await InsurancePool.getPolicy(1);
console.log(policy);

# Listen to events
InsurancePool.on("PolicyCreated", (policyId, holder, amount, premium) => {
  console.log("New Policy:", policyId.toString());
});
```
