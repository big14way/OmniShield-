## Emergency Pause Procedures

### When to Pause

**Automatic Triggers** (if monitoring enabled):
- Unexpected drain of >10% pool funds in <1 hour
- Oracle price deviation >20%
- Failed claim payment transactions
- Detected exploit signature
- Bridge connectivity loss >30 minutes

**Manual Triggers**:
- Discovery of critical vulnerability
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Audit firm recommendation
- Regulatory requirements
- Community reports of exploit

### Pause Execution

#### Method 1: Emergency Script (Fastest)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export INSURANCE_POOL_ADDRESS=0x...
export RISK_ENGINE_ADDRESS=0x...
export CLAIMS_PROCESSOR_ADDRESS=0x...

# Execute emergency pause
npm run emergency:pause

# Or directly
npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/pause-all.ts --network <network>
```

#### Method 2: Multi-sig Execution

1. **Prepare pause transaction**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/emergency/prepare-pause-tx.ts
   ```

2. **Submit to Gnosis Safe**:
   - Go to [Gnosis Safe UI](https://app.safe.global/)
   - Navigate to your Safe
   - Create new transaction
   - Paste prepared transaction data
   - Request signatures from other owners

3. **Approve & Execute**:
   - Required threshold signatures
   - Execute transaction
   - Verify pause status

#### Method 3: Direct Contract Call

```typescript
// Connect to contract
const insurancePool = await ethers.getContractAt(
  "InsurancePool", 
  INSURANCE_POOL_ADDRESS
);

// Execute pause (owner only)
const tx = await insurancePool.pause();
await tx.wait();

console.log("Emergency pause activated");
```

### Post-Pause Actions

**Immediate (Within 15 minutes)**:
1. ‚úÖ Verify all contracts are paused
2. ‚úÖ Run monitoring dashboard to assess damage
3. ‚úÖ Capture blockchain state for forensics
4. ‚úÖ Alert all stakeholders
5. ‚úÖ Post initial communication

**Short-term (Within 1 hour)**:

// Deploy new implementation
// Execute upgrade via multi-sig
// Call new recovery function
```

### Scenario 2: Exploited Funds

**Immediate Actions**:
1. **Pause all contracts** immediately
